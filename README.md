# bots-node-webhook-channels
This repository contains my webhook example node.js projects for integrating Oracle Digital Assistant using webhook channels.

My first example project is for using your chatbot with Telegram Messenger and you can read about it @ https://eocoe.blogspot.com/2018/11/use-your-chatbot-in-telegram-over.html

Second example is using Actions on Google to have the chatbot on Oracle Digital Assistnat available with Google Assistant. For more details check my blog @ https://eocoe.blogspot.com/2018/11/combine-google-assistant-with-oracle.html
